Ram’s life is exceptionally tough. However he handles them really well in the following ways. If the problem is 
1 then he just says “One is too cool and easy”  
‘h’ then he just says “To hell with it”
9.9 then he just says “I solved 1 …9.9 is nothing to me
Anything else he says “Life is just beautiful”
Hint: Exception handling
