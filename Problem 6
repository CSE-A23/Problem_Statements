Seema has a lot of bangles all stored in a box. Bangles are of different size, colors and make. She has a habit of buying bangles as pairs. She wants to pile them by sizes in such a way that the maximum sized the bangles are in the middle and the following sizes will have the placed beside each bangle. For eg four bangles with sizes 7 (one pair), 8 (one pair) will be placed as 7, 8, 8, 7. If there are more one pair of bangles of same size , the bangles of same color should not be placed in the same side. For eg: 6 blue and 6 yellow must be placed as 6B, 6Y, 7R, 8P, 8P, 7R, 6Y, 6B.  Help Seema display the bangle properties in the piled order. 

Note: 
Must use array of objects
The same size bangles must be arranged with Lexicographical order of color; in the above example Y>B so it is placed before blue bangle. Check must be done that the bangle pairs never have same attributes. 

The input is as 
T>0 – no of pairs of bangles
Next T inputs would be properties of each pair of bangles
